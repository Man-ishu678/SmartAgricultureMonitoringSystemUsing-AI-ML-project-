# Smart Agriculture Monitoring System Using AI & ML

## 🌾 Project Overview

The **Smart Agriculture Monitoring System** is an AI & ML-based application designed to recommend the most suitable crop for farming based on soil and environmental conditions. This system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze parameters such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. It helps farmers make data-driven decisions to maximize yield and sustainability.

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ Real-time crop recommendation using ML
* ✅ Data preprocessing and feature scaling
* ✅ Random Forest Classifier for accurate predictions
* ✅ Easy-to-use Python script
* ✅ Scalable for IoT integration and dashboards
